Well here is a recipe that delivers simple culinary pleasures - some nice fresh fish with a crispy crust, crunchy potato wedges and some delightfully sweet sugar snap peas flavoured with cooling mint. Slip into something comfortable and relax into a delicious dinner!",

Robed men sell ornate carpets and a camel nibbles affectionately at your ear.  OK, we’re pretty sure Paul McKenna’s job is safe for now, but get cooking this recipe and take dinnertime on a magic carpet ride to Casablanca! Our tip for this recipe is to take your meat out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before dinner which will allow you to cook it more evenly.",

    "description": "World-renowned people generally all have one thing in common: a legacy. For Henry Ford it was the motorcar, for Thomas Edison it was the lightbulb. For our intern Simon, it was this lip-smackingly awesome Sea Bream. Taking the warm crunchiness of potatoes against the fresh southern asian flavours of fish with coriander, ginger and lime, it’s the perfect dish for transporting your tastebuds. Don’t let the smell of the fish sauce throw you - add it gradually to your sauce for a really authentic asian spin!",

    "description": "Nostalgia is a powerful thing. For some it’s triggered by the smell of freshly cut grass, for others by the sound of a love song from their heady teenage years. For Head Chef Patrick it’s all about Swiss Roll. A firm dinnertime favourite from his primary school years, we still see him go all misty eyed at the mere mention of it. We’re pretty sure that was the inspiration behind this little number. Tonight, prepare to create a little nostalgia that the little ‘uns will remember for years!",

    "description": "Head Chef Patrick doesn’t like fuss. He’s always telling us that the best kind of food is simple, soulful grub that makes you feel loved. That said, every dinner is a chance to practice your presentation skills. Bigger plates are a great way of framing your food and a sprinkle of herbs or a drizzle of olive oil at the end gives everything a bit more pizzazz. For this recipe, we took classic Mexican ingredients and played with the presentation to create something that’s as tasty to the eye as it is to the tongue. Arriba!",

    "description": "We’ve all heard that much overused culinary phrase “fusion food”, but this recipe is fusion of a slightly different kind. With the onset of Winter Patrick has taken some decidedly seasonal squash and the deep, heady scent of rosemary and combined them with the lighter flavour of feta and wild rice. The squash takes a little bit of work with a vegetable peeler but once you’ve tackled and roasted it you’ll never look back. We use any leftovers for butternut squash soup!",

    "description": "‘Allo Genovese’ simply means ‘in the style of Genoa’, which is the northern Italian city famous for the pesto that you’ll be making tonight. ‘Pesto’ actually comes from the word ‘pestare’, which means to pound or crush, referring to the old fashioned method of making it in a pestle & mortar. If you happen to have a food processor, you can whizz the pesto together in that, or alternatively just chop, chop, chop everything until it is tiny. Andiamo! ",

Once served, everyone around the table must choose an \r\n\r\nItalian title and act Italian for the rest of dinner time. Andiamo!*",

    "description": "Patrick has been working on a theory that the fewer utensils you use to eat a meal, the tastier it’s likely to be. Think about it - everything you eat with only a fork is usually delicious. Dispense with cutlery entirely to use your fingers and suddenly you’re in taste bud paradise. That was the thinking behind this Japanese favourite. A surefire winner in the eateries of Tokyo, pick it up with your fingers and get stuck in! The first person to finish has to shout “Banzaaaiiii”!",
